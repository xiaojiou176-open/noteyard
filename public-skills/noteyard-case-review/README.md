# Noteyard Case Review Public Skill

This folder is the OpenHands/extensions-friendly and ClawHub-style public skill
packet for Noteyard's secondary public lane.

The flagship story is still the local copy-first Noteyard workflow plus
its explicit-case-root MCP surface. This packet exists so a host-native
reviewer can learn that workflow without turning the repo into a hosted service
or a plugin/store product pitch.

Today the secondary ClawHub packet listing is live, while the
OpenHands/extensions submission still sits in a changes-requested review state.
That means this packet can point to a real public listing without pretending
the OpenHands lane is already accepted or live.

## What this skill teaches an agent

This is not just a label for Apple Notes. It teaches an agent five concrete
things:

1. how to install or launch the Noteyard MCP surface
2. how to prove the review flow on public-safe demo artifacts first
3. how to review one copied case root without touching the live Notes store
4. how to ask bounded questions from derived artifacts instead of guessing
5. what the MCP lane gives a host after attach: case-root listing, manifest and
   artifact inspection, bounded case Q&A, and bounded
   verify/report/timeline/export workflows

## What this packet includes

- `SKILL.md`
  - the concise skill entry point for progressive disclosure
- `manifest.yaml`
  - listing metadata for ClawHub-style publication
- `references/README.md`
  - the local index for every supporting file
- `references/INSTALL.md`
  - exact install and MCP wiring examples
- `references/OPENHANDS_MCP_CONFIG.json`
  - a ready-to-edit `mcpServers` snippet
- `references/OPENCLAW_MCP_CONFIG.json`
  - a ready-to-edit `mcp.servers` snippet
- `references/CAPABILITIES.md`
  - the read-mostly case-review tool surface
- `references/DEMO.md`
  - first-success flow, real prompts, and proof/demo links
- `references/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
  - the first places to check when attach or case-root review fails

## First-success path

If a reviewer wants to understand the skill quickly, use this order:

1. read `SKILL.md`
2. open `references/INSTALL.md`
3. run the public-safe proof path from `references/DEMO.md`
4. walk `Landing -> Public Proof -> Use Cases` before opening builder or raw-source references

## Demo / proof links

Primary reviewer route:

- Landing: https://xiaojiou176-open.github.io/noteyard/
- Public proof: https://xiaojiou176-open.github.io/noteyard/proof.html
- Use cases: https://github.com/xiaojiou176-open/noteyard/blob/main/USE_CASES.md

Builder / raw-source references after the route above:

- Builder guide: https://github.com/xiaojiou176-open/noteyard/blob/main/INTEGRATIONS.md
- Distribution boundary: https://github.com/xiaojiou176-open/noteyard/blob/main/DISTRIBUTION.md
- Releases: https://github.com/xiaojiou176-open/noteyard/releases

## Visual demo

- Quick visual proof: the public demo already shows the bounded review flow on
  safe artifacts before a host ever points the MCP lane at a real copied case
  root.

## MCP capability surface

- Read-only review lane:
  `list_case_roots`, `inspect_case_manifest`, `select_case_evidence`,
  `inspect_case_artifact`, and `ask_case`
- Bounded workflows:
  `run_verify`, `run_report`, `build_timeline`, and `public_safe_export`
- Boundary:
  one explicit case root at a time, local stdio transport, and no live Notes
  store mutation path

## Best-fit hosts

- OpenHands/extensions contribution flow
- ClawHub-style skill publication
- repo-local skill import flows that expect a standalone folder
- any MCP-aware host that can launch a local stdio server on one explicit case
  root

## What this packet must not claim

- no flagship plugin/store lane for the overall product
- no official OpenHands/extensions listing without fresh PR/read-back
- no accepted OpenHands/extensions host lane just because a submission already exists
- no first-class OpenClaw bundle listing or host-wrapper acceptance just because the secondary ClawHub skill listing is live
- no hosted Glama deployment, Docker catalog listing, or remote MCP lane
- no direct mutation of the live Apple Notes store

## Source of truth

The canonical skill text still lives at:

- `skills/noteyard-case-review/SKILL.md`

This folder is a public-facing derived packet. If the canonical skill changes,
copy the updated `SKILL.md` here before publishing.
